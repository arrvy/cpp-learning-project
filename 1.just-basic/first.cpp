//though this is code for c++, but first i will write code heavily implement the basic of c (two of them is basically same)

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    int a = 5.5; //the value at floating point are neglected
    int b = a==6; //assigned the boolean value (still integer) because the result of comparison between variable a and value 6
    printf("nilai dari hasil perbandingan adalah : %d",b);
